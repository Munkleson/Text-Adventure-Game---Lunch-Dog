To find some items, you need to fulfill certain requirements
- Forgot their lunchbox, with different kinds of food there
- Certain animals may take certain foods, depending on what they like
	- i.e. mouse takes the thing with cheese

Owner forgot something

Start off
Showing life at home with the owner
Owner goes to work
You realise they left their stuff at home (3 items?)
You grab them all and set off to their job - Point of no return
- Where do they work though?
- Clues at the beginning
At the beginning of your journey, a dastardley magpie swoops in and steals your things, cackling and spreading out the belongings
	- Magpie is the final boss?
	- You find items along the way that prevent it from stealing more things when you get closer to ending the game
	- Maybe if you drop off an item at the right location, you can avoid an encounter at a later stage because they got distracted
		- Shiny bauble at a magpie nest
			- Maybe a different item to not make it so obvious? Something shiny but not explicitly stated
		- The bauble disappears when you leave the map because the magpie took it
		- Carrying the bauble means the magpie loses the ability to steal 1 item
			- "The magpie's claws are full" text comes out
You set off to find them
1 path per item


Map
- Can target a particular map you want to go to
- This creates a path that outlines the buttons you need to press to get there
	- This seems incredibly hard to program, so maybe not
	- How to find the shortest path???
- Instead, maybe make a teleport function that costs time?
- If I have a large map, I need to make each room worth visiting
	- Good dialogue



Ending:
He called me a good boy anyway. I is happy
